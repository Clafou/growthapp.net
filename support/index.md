##Is my data private?##

Yes. We don't see your data. For more details see the [privacy policy](/privacy).

##Is my data backed up?##

Your data is backed up to iTunes or to iCloud (depending on your settings) like any app data. However bad things easily happen with iTunes and iCloud backups and your child's growth is not the sort of data that you would like to lose, so we recommend that you use any of the export features to keep a copy, such as the Export All Data option on the main screen or the email feature.

##I replaced my iPhone/iPad/iPod touch. How do I recover my data?##

When setting up your new device, restore from an iCloud or iTunes backup. Your data will be there.

##How do I transfer data to my husband, wife, or my second device?##

On the home screen, tap the action button and Export All. You can also tap the action button on the chart page to only send the data for one child.
If both your devices support AirDrop, then simply tap the account to which you wish the send the data. Otherwise email the data and open this email on the second device and tap the attachment.

##Is iCloud supported?##

Not at present. AirDrop support makes data transfer easy, which lessens the need for iCloud. iCloud sync is currently [considered](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work) to be overly risky and demanding in software engineering and in customer support.

##Why are the premium features not free?##

This app is my livelihood and represents months of hard work. One upgrade (offering unlimited children, BMI, percentiles beyond one year and data import, for lifetime use on any number of devices) buys me a cup of espresso and contributes to the continued development of this app. I am grateful for your support!
