# Do not rely exclusively on iCloud Backup

You can treat *iCloud Backup* as a convenient kind of backup, but be warned: it can fail. Some Growth users have found that iCloud did not restore their data.

Even if *iCloud Backup* successfully restored your Growth data in the past, do not expect success again in future.

# How to safeguard your data

Do the following from time to time and before you replace your device:

### Option 1: Export your data

Tap on the export icon, then tap on *Export all Data* to create a file containing the child's data.
* Tap on Mail and email it yourself or to someone else. The data will then be in your mail archive.
* Use AirDrop to send the data files to another device or to your computer.
* Tap on *Save to Files* to save the data files to *iCloudÂ Drive* or to your other file locations (such as Dropbox).

### Option 2: Back up your device via USB

iTunes Backups, which you create on a computer, are more reliable than iCloud backups. For details on how to create an iTunes Backup on a computer read [this Apple support page](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT201269#itunes).

You can also use the third-party tool [iMazing](https://imazing.com) to back up your app data to a computer via USB without using iTunes.
