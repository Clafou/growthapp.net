# Keep your data safe

All the data you store in Growth is stored on your local device. It is not uploaded to the iCloud or to any other Internet location. Therefore it is important to keep a reliable backup or a copy.

# Do not rely on iCloud Backup alone

iCloud Backup creates device backups automatically when some conditions are met, but it does not always include the data you entered in all your apps. It is also subject to iCloud storage quotas.


Some Growth users who replaced their device relied on iCloud Backup to restore their data on the new device, but have found that their Growth data was missing.

Even if you have found that iCloud Backup successfully restored your Growth data in the past, do not think that you can safely expect success again in future. You need at least one non-iCloud copy to keep your precious data safe.

# Recommendations

Please make a copy or a non-iCloud backup of your data from time to time. The app will now advise you to do so after you enter a few measurements.

If you replace your device, do make a copy or an iTunes backup before getting rid of your old device.

## • Option 1: Export your data

Use the export icon on the first screen and choose "Export all Data". Or tap on the export icon in a child's charts page and choose "Send Data". In both cases the app will export a .growth file containing all the data for a child, which can then be re-imported into the app if needed. You will have the option to send this .growth file by email or AirDrop or to save it as a file in iCloud Drive or other locations such as DropBox, depending on what you have set up on your device. So long as you keep the .growth files your data is safe.

## • Option 2: Make backups via USB

iTunes Backups that you make manually on a computer are more reliable than iCloud backups. For details on how to create an iTunes Backup on a computer read [this Apple support page](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT201269#itunes).

You can also use the third-party tool [iMazing](https://imazing.com) to back up your app data to a computer without using iTunes.
