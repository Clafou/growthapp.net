###No personal data is ever collected###

Clafou Apps does not have any access to your data or to personally-identifiable information.

###Your data stays where you put it###

You have sole control of your data. It exists only on your device, in your backups (if you back up your app data using iTunes or iCloud backup) and at whichever locations you have manually transferred it to using the app's export features.

For this reason you should use make copies of your data using the export feature to protect from data loss in case of accidental deletion of the app or in case you lose your device.

###The information being collected###

My mission is to develop useful, high-quality apps. For this reason I use Crashlytics to get notifications and diagnosis data about crashes. I also use TapStream to measure marketing performance. None of the information involved includes personally-identifiable information or growth data.
