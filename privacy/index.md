### No personal data is ever collected

Clafou Ltd does not have any access to your data or to personally-identifiable information.

### Your data stays where you put it

You have sole control of your data. It exists only on your device, in your backups (if you back up your app data using iTunes or iCloud backup) and at whichever locations you have manually transferred it to using the app's export features.

For this reason you should make copies of your data using the export feature to protect from data loss in case of accidental deletion of the app or loss of your device.

### Analytics data

My mission is to develop useful, high-quality apps. For this reason I use Crashlytics to get diagnosis data about crashes, TapStream to track marketing performance, and Google analytics to monitor traffic to this website. None of the information involved includes personally-identifiable information or growth data.
