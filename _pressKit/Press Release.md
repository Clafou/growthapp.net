# "Growth", the baby and child growth charts app, celebrates its third birthday with over 200,000 downloads

Dublin, Ireland — March 14th 2014 — After three years of continued development, "Growth" by Clafou Apps is the most popular dedicated app for baby and child growth tracking on iPhone® and iPad®.

Inspired by the experience of a parent whose baby struggled to gain weight after birth, it helps parents record and chart their children's growth using the most authoritative growth standards as reference—from birth all the way to adulthood. It prints charts on the official sheets used by doctors as well as custom charts. It calculates the exact percentile for each measurement, so parents know precisely how their child is doing in relation to the expected size of a child of the same age. Its average user rating is 4.5 stars and it has topped 200,000 downloads.

"Growth" is a must-have app for parents. It is ideal for tracking newborns (the age at which growth charts are most commonly used) but continues to be of use in later years, particularly with its BMI percentile calculation which makes it easy to monitor weight throughout childhood. Multi-function baby apps include basic growth tracking, but tracking diapers, breastfeeding and sleep is (thankfully!) short-lived. In contrast, "Growth" will never look out of place on a parent's home screen.


## Features
- Multiple growth standards to choose from (WHO and CDC), with the PDF templates that pediatricians use built-in.
- Fast data input for quick use on the go. Adding measurements is two taps away.
- Lots of export options for data and charts.
- Special features for preterm babies: corrected age and dedicated preterm growth reference.


## Pricing and Availability
"Growth" is free on the App Store. It has always been ad-free but is limited to one child with percentile calculations until age 1.

Full functionality is available as an in-app purchase, or as a separate paid app called "Growth+". This offers multi-child tracking (with support to chart children together to compare them), percentile calculations for all ages, BMI score calculation with BMI chart and BMI percentiles, and data import via files or AirDrop. It is priced priced $2.99 / €2.69 / £1.99.

"Growth" is a universal app (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) and is optimized for iOS7, with backward compatibility with iOS4.2 to run on first generation iPads and iPhone 3G.

### About Clafou Apps
Clafou.com is a Dublin-based app publisher founded by Sébastien Molines. Sébastien holds a MSc in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin and grew up in France before moving to Ireland in 1996. "Growth" is Sébastien's first iOS app and follows the birth in 2010 of his son, who struggled to gain weight as a newborn. The paper-based pediatric growth charts used to track his weight were time-consuming, easy to lose, and could only give a very rough estimation of percentiles—problems now resolved by "Growth".
